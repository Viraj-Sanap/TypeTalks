The project serves to bring the MBTI model at the ease of your fingertips in the form of a mobile application. 

The project serves to bring the MBTI model at the ease of your fingertips in the form of a mobile application. The purpose of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality inventory is to make the theory of psychological types described by C. G. Jung understandable and useful in people's lives. The essence of the theory is that much seemingly random variation in the behaviour is actually quite orderly and consistent, being due to basic differences in the ways individuals prefer to use their perception and judgment. 

This project is made by Divya Sharma and Viraj Rajendra Sanap.
